            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Amit Narang, and I have a personal connection to diabetes <strong>Type 1</strong> . My son was diagnosed with this condition, and through extensive research and experimentation, I developed a diet plan that successfully reversed his diabetes.</p>
            <p>I understand the challenges that come with managing diabetes, both physically and financially. That's why I offer my services free of charge. I believe that everyone should have access to the information and support they need to improve their health.</p>
            <p>While I am not a doctor and do not prescribe medications, I can help you reduce your dependence on external insulin sources through dietary changes. My approach is safe, natural, and focused on long-term health benefits.</p>
            <p>If you find my results promising and would like to support my cause, you can contribute any amount you deem fit by scanning the QR code below. Your support helps me continue my work and reach more people in need.</p>
